Connexion Bar
==============

Provides a simple helper method that will render a GCX connexion bar in your app.

Dependencies
============

Hpricot: `gem install hpricot`

To use this helper, you also must have a properly configured cas client that uses mygcx as it's authenticating server.
Your cas client configuration must also include a valid proxy granting server.

To simplify things I've set up a ccc_rubycas_client plugin that includes a good set of default configurations that *should* 
work out of the box:

`./script/plugin install git://github.com/twinge/ccc_rubycas_client.git`

Example Usage
=============

In your layouts just after the <body> tag:

<%= connexion_bar %>

or you can specify the following options: :community, :logout, :css

<%= connexion_bar(:community => 'CampusStaff') %> # Default is the 'Public' community

<%= connexion_bar(:logout => link_to('LOGOUT', '/logout'), :css => 'http://example.com/im_special.css') %>
